# Git Workflow Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Use feature branches for new work (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive.
- Regularly pull from `main` to keep branches up to date.

## Workflow Steps

1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make changes and commit with clear messages.
3. Push branch to remote.
4. Open a pull request for review.
5. Address review comments and merge after approval.

## Best Practices

- Squash commits before merging if possible.
- Delete branches after merging.
- Tag releases for production deployments.
